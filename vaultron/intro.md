## version 0.0.1

[HashiCorp Vault](https://www.vaultproject.io) secures, stores, and tightly controls access to tokens, passwords, certificates, API keys, and other secrets in modern computing.

[Vaultron](https://github.com/brianshumate/vaultron) aims to provide a comprehensive and fun environment for learning Vault with themes from an old cartoon series called Voltron.

Vaultron is a personal project by Brian Shumate and is not officially endorsed or supported by HashiCorp.

Vaultron uses Docker and Terraform to build Vault clusters and features a rich pre-configured environment with examples and tests that are useful for generating workloads in Vault to learn in a hands-on way.

You will be guided through forming your own Vaultron and using it in this scenario.
