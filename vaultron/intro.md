[HashiCorp Vault](https://www.vaultproject.io) secures, stores, and tightly controls access to tokens, passwords, certificates, API keys, and other secrets in modern computing.

[Vaultron](https://github.com/brianshumate/vaultron) is a personal project by Brian Shumate to help newcomers explore Vault.

This lab attempts to run Vaultron with the integrated storage flavor.
