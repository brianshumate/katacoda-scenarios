> Click on the command (`⮐`) will automatically copy it into the terminal and execute it.

This step will help guide you to generate new data in Vault and as a result, new telemetry metrics in Splunk.

## Static K/V secrets

You can generate some secrets with an incrementally increasing count to produce telemetry metrics for later analysis. For commands which will produce a great deal of output, the output is sent to a log file to keep the terminal uncluttered.

Enable a K/V version 2 secrets engine to begin.

```
vault secrets enable -version=2 kv
```{{execute T1}}

Now, generate 10 secrets.

```
for i in {1..10}
  do
    vault kv put kv/$i-secret foo=bar > 10-secrets.log 2>&1
done
```{{execute T1}}

Next, generate 25 secrets and update first 10 secrets.

```
for i in {1..25}
  do
    vault kv put kv/$i-secret foo=bar > 25-secrets.log 2>&1
done
```{{execute T1}}

Finally, generate 50 secrets and update first 35 secrets.

```
for i in {1..50}
  do
    vault kv put kv/$i-secret foo=bar > 35-secrets.log 2>&1
done
```{{execute T1}}

## Tokens & Leases

Now enable a username and password (userpass) auth method and login with it to generate some tokens and leases.

First, enable the auth method.

```
vault auth enable userpass
```{{execute T1}}

Next, add a learner user with the password **p@ssw0rd**.

```
vault write auth/userpass/users/learner password=p@ssw0rd
```{{execute T1}}

Now, login to Vault 10 times as the learner user.

```
for i in {1..10}
  do
    vault login \
      -method=userpass \
      username=learner \
      password=p@ssw0rd > 10-userpass.log 2>&1
done
```{{execute T1}}

Login 25 times as the learner user.

```
for i in {1..25}
  do
    vault login \
      -method=userpass \
      username=learner \
      password=p@ssw0rd > 25-userpass.log 2>&1
done
```{{execute T1}}


Login 50 times as the learner user.

```
for i in {1..50}
  do
    vault login \
      -method=userpass \
      username=learner \
      password=p@ssw0rd > 50-userpass.log 2>&1
done
```{{execute T1}}
