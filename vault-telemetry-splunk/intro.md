<small>Scenario version 0.9.5 accompanies the [Monitoring Telemetry with Splunk guide](#)</small>

----

Vault emits rich operational and usage data to provide its users insight and intelligence about the server lifecycle. One such stream of data available from an operating Vault server are [Telemetry Metrics](https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/internals/telemetry).

<small>In addition to operational and audit logging, Vault can also export telemetry metrics.</small>

You can [configure telemetry](https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/configuration/telemetry) for either exporting metrics or pulling metrics depending on the solution you use. Aggregated metrics can then be visually analyzed with dashboards and alerted on based on your business and operational criteria.

This scenario helps you become familiar with Vault telemetry in Splunk. It uses Terraform to automate deployment of a simple Docker based infrastructure featuring a Vault server, a Telegraf agent, and a Splunk server.

You a will gain basic idea of what is possible and help inform your own telemetry aggregation and analysis solution by assembling and using the solution in this scenario.

You will perform these tasks while you work through the scenario:

1. **Start the containers** - this is where Terraform helps to automate deployment. By defining and applying a plan, you can orchestrate the entire deployment, down to all required configuration items for each component of the stack.
1. **Initialize and unseal Vault** - Prepare Vault for use by initializing it and unsealing it. You will also authenticate to Vault with the initial root token.
1. **Access Splunk Web** - Access the Splunk Web UI and initial Vault telemetry metrics.
1. **Perform actions to generate metrics** - Vault generates some runtime metrics even in an uninitialized and sealed state, but in this step you will generate additional metrics that you can then revisit in Splunk.
1. **Analyze generated metrics** - Use Splunk Web to analyze, search, and visualize your Vault telemetry metrics including a simple dashboard.
