[HashiCorp Vault](https://www.vaultproject.io) secures, stores, and tightly controls access to tokens, passwords, certificates, API keys, and other secrets in modern computing.

One part of the data available from an operating Vault instance is the [Telemetry Metrics]. These are available for exporting or pulling depending on the solution used and further analyzed in visual ways with dashboards.

This guide demonstrates an example deployment of Vault with Telegraf and Splunk to give you an basic idea of what is possible and as a means to inform your own telemetry aggregation and analysis stack.
